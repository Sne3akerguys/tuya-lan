#+TITLE: Tuya-lan

A component to integrate Tuya devices to Home Assistant without relying on Tuya's servers.
It is based on [[https://github.com/clach04/python-tuya][this python library]].

* Getting Started

Copy =__init__.py=, =manifest.json=, =sensor.py= and =switch.py= in your Home Assistant configuration folder as below:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
.homeassistant
├── automations.yaml
├── configuration.yaml
├── custom_components
│   └── tuya_lan
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── manifest.json
│       ├── sensor.py
│       └── switch.py
#+END_EXAMPLE

Add to =configuration.yaml=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sensor:
  - platform: tuya_lan
    sensors:
      mesuring:
        device_id: '<device_id>'
        api_key: '<local_key>'
        ip_address: '<ip_address>'
        platform: test # don't really know why it is required
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can get the =device_id= and the =local_key= by following [[https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi/blob/master/docs/SETUP.md][this guide]].
